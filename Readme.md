**Microsoft Web Platform Installer** - https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx

### Delete all things!
======

First you need to have a clean system - clean from any previous installations of php on your computer - in a form of php, xampp or any other tool that allows you to
work with php. The less previous 'stuff' on your computer there is, the easier this process will be :)

### Microsoft Web Platform ###

Go to https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx and download the web platform. After installation in Search type in php, and you'll see many versions of php that you'll need to install.
